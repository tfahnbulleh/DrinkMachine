# DrinkMachine

Write an applet that simulates a soft drink vending machine. The simulated
machine dispenses the following soft drink:
 Cola
 Lemon-lime
 Grape
 soda,
 root beer
 bottled water
These drinks cost #0.75 each to purchase.
When the applet starts, the drink machine should have a supply of 20 of each of the
drinks. The applet should have a text field where the user can enter the amount of
money he or she is giving the machine. The user can then click on a button to
select a drink to dispense. The applet should also display the amount of change it is
giving back to the user. The applet should keep track of its inventory of drinks and
inform the user whether he or she has selected a drink that is out of stock. Be sure
to handle operator errors such as selecting a drink with no money entered and
selecting a drink with an inadequate amount of money entered.
